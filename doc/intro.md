# Introduction to chess-engine

What I need to do: 

* Figure out what to do about turns
  They already exist in the app-state. Do I need to pass app-state around? Probably... Seems like a common idiom to always pass around the biggest possible thing
* Figure out how to deal with figuring out what pieces are implicitly specified
* Try to do more bottom up design? Getting frustrated, and I think I can do this...
